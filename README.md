# ASCVD metabolite panel

This repository contains all the scripts and necessary information to replicate the findings reported in the following publication:
"_Incremental value of a panel of serum metabolites for predicting atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk_" by Nogal et al. (2021).


Specifically, it contains the following files:
1. Script used to QC the metabolites data: _QC_metabolites_
2. Script used to pre-process the data, tune the hyperparameters and assess variable importance in the built random forest models: _RandomForest.R_
3. Table containing the demographics characteristics from the different cohorts used --> 
4. Table containing the metabolites IDs used to run the pathway enrichment analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (QIAGEN Inc.): _IPA_metabolites.xlsx_
5. File containing the analysis setting used to run IPA: _IPA_analysis_settings.pdf_


Data availability:
The data used in this study are held by the department of Twin Research at Kingâ€™s College London. The data can be released to bona fide researchers using our normal
procedures overseen by the Wellcome Trust and its guidelines as part of our core funding (https://twinsuk.ac.uk/resources-for-researchers/access-our-data/).
