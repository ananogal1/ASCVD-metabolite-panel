# ASCVD metabolite panel

Scripts to find a metabolite panel associated with the 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score and predictive of incident cardiac disease and CVD mortality used in the following publication:
"_Incremental value of a panel of serum metabolites for predicting atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk_" by Nogal et al. (2021).


This repository contains the following files:
1. Script used to QC the metabolites data -->
2. Script used to tune the hyperparameters for the build random forest models -->
3. Table containing the demographics characteristics from the different cohorts used --> 
4. Table containing the metabolites IDs used to run the pathway enrichment analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (QIAGEN Inc.) -->


Data availability:
The data used in this study are held by the department of Twin Research at Kingâ€™s College London. The data can be released to bona fide researchers using our normal
procedures overseen by the Wellcome Trust and its guidelines as part of our core funding (https://twinsuk.ac.uk/resources-for-researchers/access-our-data/).
